# Tarot Card of the Day

A dynamic web application that provides users with a tarot card for the day, along with a short interpretation and an inspirational quote.

## Description of the Problem (Pain point)
Many people enjoy small moments of inspiration, reflection, or guidance throughout their day. 
However, finding an easy and engaging way to access this experience online can be challenging.
Most traditional tarot websites are cluttered, overly complicated, or slow to load. 
Additionally, not everyone owns a physical tarot deck or has the time or knowledge to interpret the cards themselves.
This application solves the problem by offering a simple, visually appealing web experience where users can instantly 
draw a tarot card, receive a short, meaningful interpretation, and enjoy an inspirational quote — all in a single click.
